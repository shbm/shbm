## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with more than five years of experience. I'm based in Europe. I have worked at small start-ups, scale-ups, and big tech companies.
Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shbm/

Currently, I'm working on learning web3 development and mastering solidity and blockchain development. 
Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently. These projects are hosted on vercel. The front end is developed in reactjs.

- https://github.com/shbm/eth-blockchain-data-dashboard (this is a dashboard which tracks the latest events in the Ethereum blockchain)
- https://github.com/shbm/gems (It's a blockchain game in which you can mint NFTs. It is deployed on the sepolia test net)
