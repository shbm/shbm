## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with more than five years of experience. I'm based in Europe. I have worked at small start-ups, scale-ups, and big tech companies.
Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shbm/

Currently, I'm working on learning web3 development and mastering solidity and blockchain development. 
Here are some of the projects I've worked on recently.
- https://github.com/shbm/eth-blockchain-data-dashboard (this is a dashboard which tracks the latest events in the Ethereum blockchain)
- https://github.com/shbm/gems (It's a blockchain game in which you can mint NFTs. It is deployed on the sepolia test net)
